     <h2>Introduction to Form Validation</h2>
     <span class="more"><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></span>
    </div>
    
     <p class="para">Form validation means that whenever we submit data somewhere, the browser gives us an indication while filling out the data before submission if our data is incorrect or not according to the defined rules so that we never mistakenly submit the wrong data.</p>

     <h2>Client-Side Validation</h2>
     <span class="more"><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></span>
     </div>
     <p class="para">In Client-Side Validation, we define rules within the browser itself to ensure that the data entered is not incorrect, meaning the rules are only applicable within the confines of the browser.
        There are some risks involved, such as someone being able to manipulate or access your data. Therefore, it is always recommended to implement validation on both the client side and server side so that no one can manipulate or access the data. </p>

    <h2>Differences Between Client-Side and Server-Side Validation</h2>
    <span class="more"><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></span>
    </div>
        <p class="para">The Differences Between Client-Side and Server-Side Validation is that on the client side, the rules are only defined within the limits of the browser, and on the server side, it means the rules that have been set on the server. <br> <strong>For example:</strong> when we need to log in somewhere, we first enter our credentials, then the browser sends a request to the server, and then the server checks the data. If the data exists, your profile will be displayed; otherwise, it will not.</p>

        <h2>Importance of client-side and server-side validation</h2>
        <span class="more"><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></span>
        </div>
        <p class="para">
            Whenever we create a website where we are collecting data from users or having users log in, it is very important that we apply validation on both sides, meaning client-side and server-side. If this is not done, then the data of the users will not be secure, and anyone could manipulate your website and access the user's data. That’s why it is very crucial to have validation on both sides.

        <h2>The Concept Of Form Handling</h2>
        <span class="more"><i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i></span>
        </div>
        <p class="para">Whenever we visit a website where we need to fill out a form, like when signing up, there’s a process behind it. The data that the user inputs is first verified and then sent to the server. This means that the entered data is manipulated and ensured to be correct before being sent to the server. This process is known as form handling. For instance, the user’s name entered should not include any numbers, or the password should be strong. Also, during login, the credentials should be checked on the server first, and then the profile should be logged in.</p>
